    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, Football is an amazing sport. Some of the reasons are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a very fun activity</li>
      <li>You can play a variety of positions, depending on your skillset</li>
      <li>
        You have to work up to the goal of making it to the professional leagues
      </li>
      <li>The rewarding feeling of accomplishing something big</li>
      <li>The team effort</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Football is a sport that includes many of the aspects of sports that I
      like.

    <h2>Trainging in the Gym</h2>
    <p>
      Training in the Gym is a way to get my physical form stronger. The
      experience of the gym is all discipline, and having that discipline is
      something I like. The experience of the gym with friends is also great,
      because of the motivation that friends can give you. Training in the gym
      is something I need to do to get into some of my other hobbies, so I
      consider that as a Win-Win.

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      As a youner person in this society, I enjoy playing video games. I enjoy
      playing games that include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minecraft</li>
      <li>Fortnite</li>
      <li>MCOC</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes, other games will pop up when I am bored, but generally, those
      three games are the games I play the most. I prefer playing these games
      with friends, because of the team aspect of the game, and plus, I prefer
      to talk to people opposed to being alone.

    <h2>Spending time with my family</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy spending time with my family, because I like to reinforce the
      familial bond in between us. Without that bond, what are we? We spend time
      together by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking drives around the city</li>
      <li>Watching TV</li>
      <li>Eating dinner</li>
      <li>Taking walks</li>
    </ul>

      There are plenty of other things I do to occupy my time. But these four
      things are the things I enjoy doing the most. Thank you for reading, and
      have a fantastic day!
